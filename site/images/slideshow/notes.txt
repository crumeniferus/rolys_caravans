Slideshow images are intended for inclusion in smaller, less resource-hungry slideshows, and have an ideosyncratic proportion.
They should be equal to or smaller than 760 pixels wide x 280 pixels high exactly.
If the image proportions are not the same as this, scale so that the image fits _within_ an 760 x 280 box.
