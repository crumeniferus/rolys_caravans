Medium images are intended for inclusion in smaller, less resource-hungry slideshows, but are also used as a substitute for large images in mobile devices.
They should be equal to or smaller than 640 pixels wide x 480 pixels high exactly.
If the image proportions are not the same as this, scale so that the image fits _within_ an 640 x 480 box.
